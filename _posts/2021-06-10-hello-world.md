Being a full time developer, I learn new things daily. Sometimes I tend to lookup for the same things again and again.
So natually, my developer brain kicked in one day and I decided to write things down in a journal. After a while, I got 
the idea to write up things in a simple blog :sunglasses:.

So here it is, I finally managed to put up my own blog with the generous support from [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
and [Youssef Raafat's portfolYOU theme](https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU) :pray:.

Here onwards I will be blogging my day to day learnings (without much sugar coating of course :joy:)
